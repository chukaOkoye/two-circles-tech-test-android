# SuperScoreBoard

For all your up to the minute scores from around the globe.

1. ## How to set up and run the project

   - Open the project in Android Studio Narwhal 2025.1.2.
   - Go to **File → Open**, then use the file explorer to select the project root folder.
   - If prompted with a security message, confirm that you trust the project.
   - Gradle will sync automatically once the project opens.
   - After syncing completes, you should be able to build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

2. ## Complete the task

   - Use the data already being fetched by the app to bring the provided [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/design/hY3cElxFKc1mkl9oZ8GAi4/Test-Design?node-id=1-61823&t=IbXirDv081k0WauS-1) to life.
   - Aim to match the look and feel of the designs as closely as possible.
   - Show us your best practices when it comes to modelling data and presenting it on screen.
   - Write code that is testable, and add tests to demonstrate it.
   - You’re welcome to adjust or refactor any of the starter code if it helps your approach.
   - Make sure data fetching includes proper loading and error states.
   - If something about the design or data isn’t clear, make sensible assumptions—we’ll cover them in the review.
   - You can bring in frameworks if they add value, but be ready to explain your reasoning. The focus is on solid engineering, not on piling in tools for the sake of it.
   - Feel free to use the latest features from the OS, toolset, or language. There are no restrictions on minimum support.

3. ## Document and deliver

   - At the bottom of this README, include a short section with your notes.
   - Outline your approach, highlight any trade-offs you made, and call out assumptions around the data or designs.
   - This helps us understand your thinking and makes the review process smoother.
   - When you’re finished, share the completed project with us. You can either:
      - Push it to a public or private GitHub repository and share access, or
      - Send it as a zipped project folder.
